        help
            In the TinyBus, only static memory allocation has been used,
            therefore we need to know the maximum number of subscribers.

            Subscribers take up a certain amount of memory for holding
            the pointers to the state table.

    config TINYBUS_MAX_BACKLOG
        int "Maximum nuber of Events, we can keep in the ringbuffer"

        help
            Internally we use a FreeRTOS Queue for the backlog of Events.
            We use static allocation for the queue.

            Every Event needs a certain amount of memory (see Event class)

        help
            Maps lfs_malloc to ESP-IDF capabilities-based memory allocator or
            disables dynamic allocation in favour of user-provided static buffers.

        config TINYBUS_MALLOC_STRATEGY_DISABLE
            bool "Static buffers only"
            help
                Disallow dynamic allocation, static buffers must be provided by the calling application.

            bool "Default heap selection"
            help
                Uses an automatic allocation strategy. On systems with heap in SPIRAM, if
                the allocation size does not exceed SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL then internal
                heap allocation if preferred, otherwise allocation will be attempted from SPIRAM
                heap.

        config TINYBUS_MALLOC_STRATEGY_INTERNAL
            bool "Internal heap"
            help
                Uses ESP-IDF heap_caps_malloc to allocate from internal heap.

        config TINYBUS_MALLOC_STRATEGY_SPIRAM
            bool "SPIRAM heap"
            depends on SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC && ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT
            help
                Uses ESP-IDF heap_caps_malloc to allocate from SPIRAM heap.
