# Contributing to TinyBus

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TinyBus! We welcome contributions
of all kinds, including bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements,
and more.  This document outlines the guidelines we ask contributors to follow.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository:** Start by forking the TinyBus repository on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project that you can modify.

2. **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tinybus/tinybus.esp.git](https://github.com/tinybus/tinybus.esp.git)
```

3.  **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution.  Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes:

```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

    or

```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue-123  # Replace 123 with the issue number
```

## Making Changes

1.  **Follow coding style:**  While a formal style guide isn't yet fully defined, we aim for clean, consistent, and readable C++ code.  Pay attention to indentation, naming conventions, and comments.  We encourage the use of a code formatter like `clang-format`.

2.  **Build and test:**  Ensure your changes compile and pass any existing tests. 

3.  **Document your changes:**  Update the documentation (including README, code comments, and any other relevant files) to reflect your changes.  Clear and concise documentation is crucial for maintainability.

## Submitting Your Contribution

1.  **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise message.  Use the present tense and keep the first line short (under 50 characters).  Add more detail in the commit body if necessary.

```bash
    git commit -m "Add new feature: Support for XYZ"
```

2.  **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
    git push origin feature/new-feature
```

3.  **Create a pull request:**  Go to the TinyBus repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.  Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any relevant issues.
